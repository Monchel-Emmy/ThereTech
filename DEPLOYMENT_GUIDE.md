## 🚀 How to Host on cPanel

Your React project has been successfully built! Here's how to upload it to your cPanel hosting:

### 📁 Files to Upload

Upload **ALL** files from the `dist` folder to your cPanel:

1. **index.html** - Main HTML file
2. **vite.svg** - Vite logo (if needed)
3. **assets/** folder containing:
   - `index-CWPzNqtX.js` - Your React application
   - `index-B8Jeyh-L.css` - Your styles

### 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Method 1: Using cPanel File Manager
1. Log into your cPanel
2. Open **File Manager**
3. Navigate to your domain's root directory (usually `public_html`)
4. Upload all files from the `dist` folder
5. Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory

#### Method 2: Using FTP
1. Use an FTP client (FileZilla, WinSCP, etc.)
2. Connect to your hosting server
3. Upload all files from the `dist` folder to `public_html`
4. Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Single Page Application**: This is a React SPA, so all routes will work through the main `index.html`
- **No Server Required**: The built files are static and don't need a server
- **HTTPS Ready**: Your site will work with HTTPS if your hosting supports it

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you see a blank page:
1. Check that all files were uploaded correctly
2. Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Make sure your hosting supports modern JavaScript

### 📱 Your Website Features

Your There Tech website includes:
- ✅ Responsive design for all devices

- ✅ Optimized for performance

### 🎯 Next Steps

After uploading:
1. Test your website on different devices
2. Check that all links work correctly
3. Test the contact forms
4. Verify mobile menu functionality

Your website should be live at your domain once uploaded! 🎉
